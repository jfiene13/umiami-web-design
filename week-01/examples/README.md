Have you ever tried to code a web page in a word processor? Stop! Don't! You shouldn't!

The text within `html-file-created-in-word-bad-bad-bad.docx` is a simple web page. We renamed the file to `html-file-created-in-word-bad-bad-bad.html`, indicating an html document.

If you open `html-file-created-in-word-bad-bad-bad.html` in a web browser, you should see a bunch of garbage characters. Documents created in word processors are binary files.

Now open `html-file-created-in-a-text-editor-good-good-good.html` and you'll see how an html file _should_ look in a web browser. It looks normal because  we used a plain text editor to create the document.

We use word processors make text visually appealing for humans. We use text editors to make our code and commands palatable for computers.
