<h1>Exercise: Web Graphics</h1>

<p>To do this exercise, find an image released into the public domain. Many government entities (U.S. Military, NASA, National Parks Service, etc.) provide such photos. Download a high-resolution image (preferably 300dpi). Remember to document where you downloaded the image from so you can <em>cite</em> and <em>link back</em> to the source.</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Create a directory, <code>web-graphics</code>.</li>
  <li>Within <code>web-graphics</code>, create another directory, <code>img</code>.</li>
  <li>Re-size your image to about 400 pixels by 300 pixels (or flipped if your photo has a vertical orientation).</li>
  <li>Save your images in the <code>img</code> directory in the following formats:
    <ul>
      <li>GIF</li>
      <li>PNG-8</li>
      <li>PNG-24</li>
      <li>JPEG, Low quality</li>
      <li>JPEG, Medium quality</li>
      <li>JPEG, High quality</li>
      <li>JPEG, Very high quality</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>When you name your images, come up with a standarn pattern for each. See the <code>week-02/web-graphics/img</code> folder on GitHub for examples.</li>
  <li>Record what the file size (in kilobytes) is for each image.</li>
</ol>

<p>In a plain text file, write about 300-400 words about each file format (GIF, PNG and JPEG) and its benefits. Would you use one format over another? How do the different images differ in quality and size? Can you see where there is a good tradeoff between size and quality in the different JPEG files? What about the PNG and GIF files?</p>

<p>Your explanation should be well-written, but as if you were explaining this to a friend who has asked you for advice about their own web site. (And don't copy and answer the questions I've listed above.)</p>

<p>Save your <code>web-graphics</code> directory and its contents to your GitHub account.</p>
