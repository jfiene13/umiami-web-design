#READ ME

Building upon [Example 1](https://github.com/erinbrown/umiami-web-design/blob/master/week-04/example-01), we now add structure to our page.

Notice how we have:

- created a header which contains are main page headline (h1)

- used the section element to identify chunks of content

- used the article element to identify written content

- used the aside element to identify sidebar content
