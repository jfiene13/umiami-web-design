Building upon [Example 1](https://github.com/erinbrown/umiami-web-design/blob/master/week-04/example-01) and [Example 2](https://github.com/erinbrown/umiami-web-design/blob/master/week-04/example-01), let's introduce a very basic site architecture as well as examples of absolute and relative links.

Notice how we have:

- created a new directory, `candidates`, which contains a page about each candidate

- introduced navigation for sections on the page

- introduced external links

- introduced relative [URL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_locator)s (uniforce resource locator -- a.k.a. a web address) to include images and links to files within our mini site
