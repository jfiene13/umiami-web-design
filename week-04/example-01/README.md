Example 1 demonstrates a bare-bones version of the [Presidential Election exercise](https://github.com/erinbrown/umiami-web-design/blob/master/week-03/exercise-140129.html).

Notice how we have:

- created a basic directory structure for our site (i.e. css, img, index.html, js)

- provided a clear hierarchy of information using different headlines (h1-h4)

- we specify date information using the time element and datetime attrbute

- we use the abbr element to clarify 'DC'

- we link to our sources

- created a simple table with proper headers

- our image is saved as a png and marked up as a figure with a figure caption

- our image is stored in a proper folder (img)

- utilized ordered lists
