    <h1>Building Your First Page</h1>

    <p>You have learned to create a basic HTML page, tags to format text and structure a document, lists and tables to format data and prepare images for the web.</p>

    <p>Let's put all those tools to use.</p>

    <p>Your assignment is to create a one-page document with information about the 2012 Presidential Election. We've provided most of the content (see <code>election.txt</code>), but you are welcome to add more.</p>

    <h2>Requirements</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>A proper HTML document foundation (i.e. <code>head</code>, <code>body</code>, etc.)</li>
      <li>Content organized using the array of structural tags (i.e. <code>header</code>, <code>section</code>, <code>article</code>, etc.)</li>
      <li>Textual content about the election (provided)</li>
      <li>A data table (provided)</li>
      <li>An image of the electoral map (provided)</li>
      <li>Lists of the top 5 states for each candidate (provided)</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>A few notes...</h2>

    <p>&bull; Your data table is presented in csv (comma separated value) format. It can be organized horizontally, vertically. Do you find one way is easier to read or understand than another? Experiment!</p>

    <p>&bull; You will want to re-size the electoral map image to a reasonable height/width and save it in a proper format. Technically this graphic is a figure. Is there a way to mark up a figure and give it a proper caption in HTML?</p>

    <p>&bull; <strong>Be creative!</strong> Perhaps you would like to include more information such as a brief bio and/or photo of each candidate in a separate article. Maybe you come across some additional statistics that can be presented as a table and/or list. What about links to web sites about the election? Maybe you can add a video?</p>

    <p>&bull; Be sure to keep your files organized (i.e. images in the <code>img</code> directory).</p>

    <p>&bull; Only use content which is public domain and/or licensed through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license">Creative Commons</a>. Always remember to cite your sources!</p>
